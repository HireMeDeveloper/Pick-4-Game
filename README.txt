Summary:
    This is a file that compiles a handful of notes to make testing the implementation easier.

Notes on Implementation:
    DATE_OF_FIRST_PUZZLE:
        The puzzle picked for each day is based on how many days it has been since the DATE_OF_FIRST_PUZZLE variable.
        Set this variable to change which day should be the first puzzle in the game.
        This can be found at the top of main.js.
    Updating Dictionaries:
        There is currently an example output of what the game will read for puzzles. This is a list of all of the puzzles to be used in the game. I can rework it to gather
        the data for any layout that you give me.

Questions:
    In the stats page, do you want the streaks to be for wins, completed games, or just plays?
